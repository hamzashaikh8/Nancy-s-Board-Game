# Nancy-Board-Game

  Welcome to Nancy's warrior game! Here we will be programming an 		  interactive video game which consists of two players racing their way to the 		  top of a board. The board is consisted of multiple levels and a size that the 		  user will select. There will be two dices that the players will roll at each 		  turn to advance their location on the game. When a player reaches the last 		  location on a level, he will be automatically redirected to the next level 		  and continuing his path. Each player will commence with 10 energy units which 		  will allow him to move. Landing on certain squares will add or remove energy 		  units. .In addition, landing on an already occupied square will give you the 		  possibility to challenge the player there and potentially gain half of that 		  person's energy units. Whenever a player lands a double, his energy units go 		  up by two.The minimal energy requirement is one energy unit, if a player does 		  not fulfill this requirement, then he is too weak to move. The objective of 		  the game is to reach the last square at the top level of the board before 		  your opponent We have already set up our classes and methods in separate 		  public java classes, so please do not hesitate to have a look at them before 		  embarking on this coding journey
